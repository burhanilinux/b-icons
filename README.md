###Using the Source

There are scripts to simplify the rendering process; to run them (and edit icons) you will need:

 * inkscape
 * python3

To render new icons from their source SVG files, run the following:

    ./render-pngs.py

If it's throwing an error, the script may not be executable, try:
	
	chmod +x render-pngs.py

This script will look in the source directories (../src/*) and render the respective icons (provided there are changes).
